<p>We saw, that anonymous volumes are <strong>removed automatically</strong>, when a container is removed.</p><p>This happens when you start /&nbsp;run a container with the <code>--rm</code> option. </p><p>If you start a container <strong>without that option</strong>, the anonymous volume would <strong>NOT&nbsp;be removed,</strong> even if you remove the container (with <code>docker rm ...</code>).</p><p>Still, if you then re-create and re-run the container (i.e. you run <code>docker run ...</code> again), a n<strong>ew anonymous volume will be created</strong>. So even though the anonymous volume wasn't removed automatically, it'll also <strong>not be helpful </strong>because a different anonymous volume is attached the next time the container starts (i.e. you removed the old container and run a new one).</p><p>Now you just start <strong>piling up a bunch of unused anonymous volumes </strong>- you can <strong>clear them</strong> via <code>docker volume rm VOL_NAME</code> or <code>docker volume prune</code>.</p>
