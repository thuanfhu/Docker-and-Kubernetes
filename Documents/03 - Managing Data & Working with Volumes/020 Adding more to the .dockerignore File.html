<p>You can add more "to-be-ignored" files and folders to your <code>.dockerignore</code> file. </p><p>For example, consider adding the following to entries:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">Dockerfile
.git</pre><p>This would ignore the <code>Dockerfile</code> itself as well as a potentially existing <code>.git</code> folder (if you are using Git in your project).</p><p>In general, you want to add anything which isn't required by your application to execute correctly.</p>
