<p>One important note about <strong>environment variables and security</strong>:&nbsp;Depending on which kind of data you're storing in your environment variables, you might not want to include the secure data directly in your <code>Dockerfile</code>.</p><p>Instead, go for a separate environment variables file which is then only used at runtime (i.e. when you run your container with <code>docker run</code>).</p><p>Otherwise, the values are "baked into the image"&nbsp;and everyone can read these values via <code>docker history &lt;image&gt;</code>.</p><p>For some values, this might not matter but for credentials, private keys etc. you definitely want to avoid that!</p><p>If you use a separate file, the values are not part of the image since you point at that file when you run <code>docker run</code>. But make sure you don't commit that separate file as part of your source control repository, if you're using source control.</p>
