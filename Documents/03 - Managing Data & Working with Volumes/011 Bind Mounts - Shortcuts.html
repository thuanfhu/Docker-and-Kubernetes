<p>Just a quick note:&nbsp;If you don't always want to copy and use the full path, you can use these <strong>shortcuts</strong>:</p><p><strong>macOS /&nbsp;Linux</strong>: <code>-v $(pwd):/app</code></p><p><strong>Windows</strong>:&nbsp;<code>-v "%cd%":/app</code></p><p>I&nbsp;don't use them in the lectures, since I&nbsp;want to show an approach that works for everyone (and I&nbsp;don't want to switch between both all the time), but you can use these shortcuts depending on which OS&nbsp;you are working on to save some typing.</p><p><br></p>
